      <p>
        Is it too late to learn coding in your 30s?” That’s a question that
        haunted me for years. And yet here I am—37 years old, diving headfirst
        into the world of web development.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I’m Learning to Code at 37</h2>
      <p>
        I come from a background in film and writing. For years, I was
        surrounded by stories, screenplays, and sets—but I always had a quiet
        fascination with the digital world. The day I truly saw a websitenot
        just as a page but as a living, functioning structure. I was hooked. I
        wanted to know:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>How are websites built?</li>
        <li>Who designs them?</li>
        <li>What tools and skills power them?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Is Age Just a Number?</h2>
      <p>
        People often say, *“Age is just a number.”* A girl told me that the
        other day when I mentioned I was learning to code at 37. But let’s be
        real: self-doubt creeps in. Coding seems like a long journey—3 to 4
        years to get good, and even longer for mastery. Still, I’ve decided to
        stop delaying and start learning. <br /><br />
        I want to develop my own projects. I have tons of ideas, and all of them
        involve web development. So why not finally build the skills to bring
        them to life?

      <h2>Why I’m Documenting This Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        There’s another reason I’m putting this out here. Accountability. I’m
        documenting my journey publicly, through blog posts and videos, to make
        sure I stay on track. I can’t afford to slack. I want to learn to code
        fast, and smart. <br /><br />
        That’s where my obsession with accelerated learning comes in. I’ve
        always been drawn to optimizing how we learn. So this will be my biggest
        personal case study yet—can you really learn coding quickly in your 30s,
        without a tech degree?

      <h2>The Deeper Motivation: Work Freedom</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s talk about work in India. The jobs suck. Long hours. Low pay.
        Politics. And don’t even get me started on traffic—2 to 3 hours lost
        every day just commuting. <br /><br />
        I don’t want that life. I want to work from home. I want control over my
        time and projects. And coding offers that freedom—whether it’s
        freelancing, building my own apps, or even launching a startup.
      </p>
      <!-- end of section 3  -->

      <h2>My Plan Moving Forward</h2>
      <p>
        I know this journey won't be easy. But I’m aiming to compress 3-4 years
        of traditional learning into one ultra-focused year. I’ll share every
        step—what I’m learning, what’s working, and what’s not. <br /><br />If
        you're wondering if it's too late to start coding, I hope this story
        proves otherwise.
